## API Integration
- **User**: If needed, how will you integrate the app with external APIs? Which APIs would you prefer using for user authentication?
- **Assistant**: Explained API integration steps and recommended Auth0, Firebase Authentication, Okta, and Amazon Cognito for authentication.

## API Rate Limits and Error Handling
- **User**: What considerations have you made for API rate limits and error handling?
- **Assistant**: Discussed strategies like monitoring rate limit headers, implementing backoff strategies, and robust error handling.

## Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms
- **User**: What authentication and authorization mechanisms will you implement?
- **Assistant**: Suggested OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JWT, MFA, RBAC, ABAC, and policy-based access control.

## Performance Monitoring
- **User**: How will you monitor and address performance bottlenecks?
- **Assistant**: Recommended using APM tools, logging, metrics collection, and addressing bottlenecks through optimization and scaling.

## OOP for App Design
- **User**: Do you believe that object oriented programming is a good framework to have for designing such an app?
